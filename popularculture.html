    <h1>Converse in Pop Culture</h1>

    <div class="other">
        <p>Throughout the years, Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars made a shift from athletic sportswear to casual footwear. Originally an elite basketball shoe, the Chuck Taylor All Star evolved into the shoe of choice for many subcultures, particularly artists and musicians.</p>

    <div id="main">
        <p>In the 1960s, Converse began to expand their company and open more factories and by that time, Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars were being worn by ninety percent of professional and college basketball players. As the years went on, the shoe gained more popularity and became a favorite for numerous groups and subcultures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="other">
        <p>Nearly five hundred films and television shows feature actors in a leading or main supporting role wearing Chucks. David Tennant wore three different colored pairs of Chuck Taylors throughout the British TV show <i>Doctor Who</i>, when he played the Tenth Doctor, and the titular character in the American TV show Chuck (TV series), played by Zachary Levi, wore Chucks throughout the course of the series. Chucks made many appearances in other notable films such as The Sandlot, Grease, The Right Stuff, Rocky, Over The Edge, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Stand By Me (film), The Outsiders (film), Get A Clue, Bruce Almighty, Jurassic World, I, Robot, Sin City, worn by Elvis Presley in Follow That Dream, Bridge to Terabithia, Change Of Habit, and A Beautiful Mind.</p>
