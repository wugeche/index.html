<h1>1941–2001: War, bankruptcy, and new management</h1>

<main><p>When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, Converse shifted production to manufacturing rubberized footwear, outerwear, and protective suits for the military. Widely popular during the 1950s and 1960s, Converse promoted a distinctly American image with its Converse Yearbook. Artist Charles Kerins created cover art that celebrated Converse's role in the lives of high school and college athletes.</p> </main>

     
 <p>Converse lost a vast monopoly from the 1970s onward, with the surge of new competitors, including Puma and Adidas, then Nike, then a decade later Reebok, who introduced radical new designs to the sports market. Converse found themselves no longer the official shoe of the National Basketball Association, a title they had relished for many years. </p>

<p>The chevron and star insignia—a logo that remains on a large portion of Converse footwear other than the All Star—was created by Jim Labadini, an employee.</p> 

 <p>Canvas-rubber shoes regained popularity in the 1980s as casual footwear, but Converse eventually became over-dependent on the "All Stars" brand, whose market collapsed by 1989-1990 as America entered a severe economic recession and the icons of the decade were subject to a wide backlash. By the second half of the 1990s, Converse was slipping repeatedly into receivership as debt piled up yearly, and its products were rejected by consumers in an increasingly competitive environment.</p> 

 <p>The loss of market share, combined with poor business decisions, forced Converse to file for bankruptcy on January 22, 2001. In April 2001, Footwear Acquisitions, led by Marsden Cason and Bill Simon, purchased the brand from bankruptcy and added industry partners <b>Jack Boys</b>, <b>Jim Stroesser</b>, <b>Lisa Kempa</b>, and <b>David Maddocks</b> to lead the turnaround of America's Original Sports Company. </p>
 
<h2>Nike</h2>

<p>In July 2003, Nike paid $309 million to acquire Converse. Nike approached the 1980s revival around 2005 to relaunch the footwear of choice of that decade, and the "Chucks" quickly became a cultural phenomenon once again. As a result, Nike expanded the Converse brand to other businesses apart from shoes, much akin to its other brands.</p> 

 <p>By November 2012, Converse had disappeared completely from the NBA, as the last dozen players wearing the brand either left the NBA or switched shoes over a period of a year and a half. <b>Carlos Arroyo</b> went overseas in late 2011, and Maurice Evans last played for the Washington Wizards in April 2012. Nine switched to Nike: Acie Law <i>(who went overseas)</i> in late 2011; <b>JJ Barea</b> and <b>Kirk Hinrich</b> during the 2011–12 season; <b>Luke Harangody</b> and <b>Larry Sanders</b> after the season; <b>Elton Brand</b>, <b>Louis Williams</b>, and <b>Kyle Korver</b> for the 2012–13 season; and Chris Andersen during the season. <b>Udonis Haslem</b>, the last NBA player wearing Converse on the court, followed Miami Heat teammate <b>Dwyane Wade</b> to switch to Li-Ning in late November 2012.</p>
