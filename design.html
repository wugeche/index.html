  <h1>Design</h1>
<div id="main">  <p>In 1923, after Chuck Taylor made improvements to the shoe, Converse decided to incorporate his name onto the ankle patches that displayed the Converse All Star logo. Then, in the 1930s Taylor's signature was put into the design, which is how the shoe became known as the "Chuck Taylor" All Star. When first created, the Converse All Star had three main styles—a monochromatic shoe with a black canvas upper and black rubber soles, an all white shoe with blue and red trim, and an all black leather and rubber shoe. It was not until 1949 that Converse decided to make the toe guard, laces and outer wraps white, which gave the appearance of the iconic black and white Converse All Stars of today. In 1986, Converse came out with the low-cut "Oxford" version of the All Star and soon after started to produce the shoes in multiple colors and prints. Today, Converse makes the Chuck Taylor All Star in a variety of colors, styles, prints and fabrics.</p></div>

<div class="other"><p>While the high-cut shoes feature the iconic ankle patch All Star logo, the heel of the shoe (both high and low-cuts) also includes the logo, which is glued on and reads: ALL★STAR. The low-cuts do not feature the ankle patch; however, they have a tag stitched on the tongue which has the same logo as the heel. In 2013, the logo has slightly altered on the heel and tongue. It contains the word "CONVERSE", in addition to ALL★STAR. The ankle patches of the high-cut shoes are unchanged.</p></div>

<div class="other"><p>In early 2013, Converse launched the Chuck Taylor All Star '70, which featured a build similar to the All Stars used for basketball that were built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This retro model was different from the then-current Chuck Taylor All Stars due to various changes that happened to the All Star shoes over the intervening three decades. The '70 model featured thicker canvas, a higher rubber midsole and foxing, thicker cushioning, a smaller toe cap, extra material that was stitched on the side wall behind the toe cap for reinforcement, a one-piece rubber bottom sole versus the three piece sole on the modern All Stars, and a black heel patch versus a white one on the modern All Star.</p></div>

<h2>Chuck II with knit canvas</h2>

<div class="other">
<p>On July 28, 2015, Converse released the Chuck Taylor All Star II. This shoe differed from the standard, modern All Star in several ways:</p></div>

  <ul>  <li>a thicker Tencel canvas;</li>
        <li>a higher rubber midsole and foxing similar in size to the All Star '70, but using lighter weight rubber;</li>
        <li>a new thicker Lunarlon cushioning;</li>
        <li>a slightly smaller toe cap;</li>
        <li>two elastic bands at the base of the tongue, to avoid slippage to the sides;</li>
        <li>a sewn-on ankle patch on the high-tops;</li>
        <li>a two-piece rubber bottom sole versus the three piece sole on the modern All Stars;</li>
        <li>a heel patch with 3D letters versus a flat one on the modern All Star.</li>
        </ul>
<div class="other"> <p>A few months after the release of the Chuck II, some special series were released with different canvas textures, like the Chuck II Knit, the Chuck II Shield Canvas and the Chuck II Rio Open Knit, to celebrate the Rio Olympics.</p></div>

<div class="other"><p>One year after the release, the Chuck II was considered a commercial failure, with retailers reporting poor sales.</p></div>
  
  <h2>Converse Modern</h2>
 <div class="other"> <p>
In June 2017, Converse announced a new line of sneakers for release in America, designed by Hiroshu Fujiwara, Tinker Hatfield, and Mark Parker. Both a hi-top and a low-top range are planned, with the initial colors being silver, royal blue, red, green, and black. A Luxe range in white or black patent leather is also planned, for business casual wear. These shoes followed the classic Chuck Taylor design but featured the following improvements: </p></div>

 <ul>   <li>Circular knit upper, with futuristic shiny finish.</li>
        <li>A cushioned foam rubber sole similar to the Air Jordans.</li>
        <li>Neoprene tongue.</li>
        <li>TPU fused toecap.</li>
        </ul>
